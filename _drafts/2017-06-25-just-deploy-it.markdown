I'm blogging and looking for the best way to deploy this blog, recording all steps here. 
I hope to help more people to use this same tools, encouraging them to learn more about coding too. 
The scenario and the tools were described in 
[the previous post](/jekyll/update/development/2017/06/24/finally-we-launch.html). Let's go!

I decided to keep my source code at [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/) and host 
it in [Gandi](http://gandi.net/) with [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and 
I'm reading more about how to do it in [this friendly blog](http://spector.io/how-to-set-up-github-pages-with-a-custom-domain-on-gandi/),

I'm trying to recover my username in Gandi.net, as they did a huge change in their system. Wish me luck.

I just found out my Gandi account was *blocked* since May 25th, because I didn't 
have my contact email verified ^^
