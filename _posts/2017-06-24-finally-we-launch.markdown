Initially, I just wanted to blog quickly, because I really want to deploy this page soon, but, in a more appropriated moment, I'll take a look 
over other themes and more enhancements, as I realized that [Minima theme](https://jekyll.github.io/minima/) doesn't 
support some nice little things, like URL to the main social networks, i18n, and so on. 

Moreover, currently I'm learning about some wonderful tools which are helping me 
to launch this page right now:
* [Cloud9](https://c9.io/), 100% online IDE;
* finally a have a [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/) repo - where I'm storing my page's source code;
* and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), of course, which generated this page, allowing me to focus on content and deployment at this moment

The purpose is more a page where I can show my projects than a blog. I'll blog when it is possible, but don't expect many posts, ok?  

Thank you! (:  

PS: Probably you will find some weird English mistakes here, as I'm not a 
native English speaker. So, I ask you to help me to learn more about this remarkable language: just send me a message whenever you see an error and I will correct it ASAP ;)
